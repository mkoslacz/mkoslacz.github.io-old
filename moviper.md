[Moviper](https://github.com/mkoslacz/Moviper) is a Mosby based Android VIPER library architected and leaded by me and developed by me and my team. It's the response for replacing god-class Activities and Fragments to god-class Presenters in the MVP architecture. In this blog you can read various posts about this library, containing its motivation, philosophy, features and usage.
