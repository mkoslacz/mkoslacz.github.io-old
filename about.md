I'm Mateusz Ko≈õlacz and I'm a senior Android developer and a Tech Lead of a "Las Motosierras" mobile development team in [Movibe](https://movibe.it/) / [Wirtualna Polska](https://onas.wp.pl/). I'm also a co-founder of a [Faver](http://faverit.org/) startup. I'm an enthusiast of a self-explaining, clean, comprehensible and maintainable architecture and code that provides long-term maintainable, bulletproof products that can share modules. This is my personal blog where I publish my thoughts, observations and various curiosities.
